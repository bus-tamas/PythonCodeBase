Exploratory Data Analysis with Superstore Data
  The Colab notebook conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset using Python's pandas and seaborn libraries.
  
  Steps: 
  I loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame, then displayed basic information about the dataset, such as the first and last few rows, data types, and summary statistics.
  The dataset was already in cleaned format (without null values or duplicates), so no further actions were needed.
  I created boxplots to visually analyze the distribution of Sales and Profit across different product categories. 
  Then I used pie charts to illustrate the ratios of different segments, regions, and product categories within the dataset.
  After that I plotted a bar chart related the top 20 Products by count and the top 10 products by profit.
  Then I used binning technique to categorize the sales records into 5 different categories and visualized it on a bar chart.
  Then I Converted 'Order Date' to datetime format and analyzes daily sales trends in the year 2014, 2015, 2016.
  I generated a correlation heatmap for all numerical columns and explored the correlation between Sales and Profit using a scatter plot.
  I constructed a bubble chart to visualize the relationship between Sales, Profit, and Quantity, with bubble size representing Quantity.
  Finally I used a pair plot to explore the relationships between numerical columns, focusing on Profit, Sales, and Quantity.


Loading the dataset into MySQL database --> (dataset_to_mysql.py)

  This Python file establishes a connection to a MySQL database, reads a CSV file ('Superstore.csv') using pandas,
  and creates a table named 'Superstore' with specified column names and data types if it doesn't exist.
  The program then iterates through the rows of the DataFrame, converts date formats, and inserts the data into the MySQL table using parameterized queries.
  After committing the changes, it closes the database connection.

Visualizations -->  (final_project.pbix)

I have developed a dashboard for the dataset, incorporating a slicer to facilitate the selection of the desired year or period for visualization. 
The dashboard features three key performance indicators (KPIs): the Sum of Sales, Sum of Quantity, and Sum of Profit. 
Additionally, I presented a geographical breakdown of sales across various regions, providing a map view that includes different states within the United States. 
To explore the relationship between sales and profit, I plotted a graph depicting their correlation across different ship modes. 
Lastly, I utilized a pie chart to visually represent the proportion of different categories within the dataset.
