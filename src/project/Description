Exploratory Data Analysis with Superstore Data
This Colab notebook conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset using Python's pandas and seaborn libraries.

Steps: 
I loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame, then displayed basic information about the dataset, such as the first and last few rows, data types, and summary statistics.
The dataset was already in cleaned format (without null values or duplicates), so no further actions were needed.
I created boxplots to visually analyze the distribution of Sales and Profit across different product categories. 
Then I used pie charts to illustrate the ratios of different segments, regions, and product categories within the dataset.
After that I plotted a bar chart related the top 20 Products by count and the top 10 products by profit.
Then I used binning technique to categorize the sales records into 5 different categories and visualized it on a bar chart.
Then I Converted 'Order Date' to datetime format and analyzes daily sales trends in the year 2014, 2015, 2016.
I generated a correlation heatmap for all numerical columns and explored the correlation between Sales and Profit using a scatter plot.
I constructed a bubble chart to visualize the relationship between Sales, Profit, and Quantity, with bubble size representing Quantity.
Finally I used a pair plot to explore the relationships between numerical columns, focusing on Profit, Sales, and Quantity.
